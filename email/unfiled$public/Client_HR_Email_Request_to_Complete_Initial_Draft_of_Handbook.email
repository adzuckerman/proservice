Dear {!Account.Contact_1__c},

I hope all is well with you.  I am writing to follow up on the emails that I sent to you requesting [insert nature of request (i.e., fill out handbook addendum questionnaire, copy of existing employee handbook, etc.].  To date, I have not received the necessary information from you, so I am not able to complete your company’s request for a customized handbook. 

As you may know, it is important that your company have an updated employee handbook in place to ensure your company’s compliance with state and federal employment laws, and to serve as a communication tool with your employees as to your company’s expectations and rules. Our team is committed to minimizing your company’s labor and employment related risk.  Accordingly, since I have not received all of the necessary information to complete your company’s customized handbook, I will be closing my files with respect to this handbook matter.  I also understand that you will adopt the ProService Hawaii standard handbook (a copy of which is attached), and will be distributing it to your employees. 

Should you have any questions or concerns, or if you wish to proceed with customizing your company’s employee handbook, please feel free to contact me. 

Sincerely,
HR Consultant
